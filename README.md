# Andy test block

This is a scratchpad of a Gutenberg block for WordPress, based on [wordpress/create-block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/).

I primarily use it for testing out things to do with how the block editor in WordPress works, and to make sure that custom blocks still work as expected.

It is very likely not going to be of use for anyone else, but feel free to have a look around!
